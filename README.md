# MS-Unit Testing

This is Labb 5 in the Course Avancerad .NET at Campus Varberg in Sweden.
I will reuse an previous project called Team Lemon. It was an bank application that we made as our first group project.

## Places of Eventual Errors
I will look at the code that we have written and try to find some functions that are critical for the program to work perfectly.

### Point of Error : 1
I will do a MSUnit test for the function "InternalTransfer" inside of "AccountManagement.cs" to ensure that all transfers within the same user will go smooth and not fail.
